TODO:
-	Fix commands marked with "not working" (examine and drop)

-	More rooms and better room descriptions

-	Increase flexability of item names (especially names with spaces), so something like "rows of chairs" could be reconized as "rows", "chairs", "chair", or "rows of chairs"

-	Add signal trapping
