TODO:

-	More rooms and better room descriptions

-	Increase flexability of item names (especially names with spaces), so something like "rows of chairs" could be reconized as "rows", "chairs", "chair", or "rows of chairs"

-	Add signal trapping

-	Add way to "listen radio"

-	Add a function for when the player dies

-	Add gun somewhere so the bear can be killed
