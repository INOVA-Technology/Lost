-	Fix commands marked with "not working" (examine and drop)

-	Increase flexability of item names (especially names with spaces), so something like "rows of chairs" could be reconized as "rows", "chairs", "chair", or "rows of chairs"

-	Fix problem with hidden rooms (like under the chairs) saying theres an item somewhere when it has been taken

-	Add signal trapping
